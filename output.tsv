Jack hoped that it was time for lunch because he was getting very hungry. He hope that there would be cookies to eat, he didn't want for there to be any vegetables.  When they got to the house, his auntie was waiting there with a cake for them.  Jack was excited and finished the sandwiches that she had made them for lunch.\newline\newlineWhen they were finished his uncle told him that it was time to go home.  It was getting late and Jack was going to be late for his bedtime if they didn't hurry.  His bedtime was going to be a little earlier tonight because he had to go visit the doctor tomorrow and so there would be no story time before bed.  \newline\newlineJack told his uncle that he had a great day and hoped that they could do it again soon.

14	Hi there! How are you doing today? I was hanging out with my friend earlier today. I am looking for a guy in a blue shirt and blue pants. Have you seen him? I cannot find him, and I thought I looked everywhere. I have checked behind the green couch and he was not there. I looked inside the white refrigerator and he was not there either. I looked to the left and looked to the right of the television and he was not in those places either!\newline\newlineWhere would you look for someone? Where would you look in their house? I think he could be in one of the other rooms here. I checked in the living room and it was empty. I checked in the bedroom and it was empty too! I knocked on the bathroom door and that was empty. It is easy to find him because he is in blue.\newline\newlineWait, what's that? You said you saw someone in the kitchen? What were they wearing? Were they wearing a blue shirt? Oh they weren't? I think that could still be my friend! I'll head over to the kitchen, you can follow if you want. There's my friend! And he's wearing an orange shirt now; he must have left to change his shirt. Thank you so much!		What color did I say he was wearing?	green	orange	blue	white	blue

Josh spends every summer there, and this summer would be no different! In the mornings, Josh and Grandma would plant cucumbers, tomatoes, and carrots in the ground.

20	When it is the end of school and the weather is warmer, that is a beautiful time called summer. Summer is wonderful because there are so many amazing things to do! You can wear fun dresses and get dirty playing outside, or you can stay inside all day and watch television. You can also ride your bike, meet up with friends during any time of the day, or maybe even eat ice-cream for breakfast! I have a birthday during the warmer summer weather and sometimes it is hard to get all my friends together at my home for cake and presents because they are on vacation! When I see my friends at school later they wish me happy birthday. My friends like me, but sometimes it is not so easy to get together. That's a stinker when that happens. It's a good thing that I have a pig named Joseph to be my friend during those times! I also have other friends, like a cat and a dog, but Joseph is the best. He's a stinker sometimes, but he's got cute little oinks to help me to know what he needs. He's also very sweet, caring, and he's always ready to listen. He's a wonderful friend.

20	When it is the end of school and the weather is warmer, that is a beautiful time called summer. Summer is wonderful because there are so many amazing things to do! You can wear fun dresses and get dirty playing outside, or you can stay inside all day and watch television. You can also ride your bike, meet up with friends during any time of the day, or maybe even eat ice-cream for breakfast! I have a birthday during the warmer summer weather and sometimes it is hard to get all my friends together at my home for cake and presents because they are on vacation! When I see my friends at school later they wish me happy birthday. My friends like me, but sometimes it is not so easy to get together. That's a stinker when that happens.

22	The red fox slowly walked out of his den he lives in; his own house in the ground. His eyes bounced side to side as he made sure the coast was clear, then he ran down the path of autumn leaves. As he reached the end there was a an apple tree without leaves, but still one shiny red colored apple hung from a branch. He climbed up a nearby rock and took a running start towards the branch, jumping and barely grabbing on. He slowly crawled along the branch towards the shiny apple, and as he drew close, he reached out a paw towards the apple. He knocked the apple from the branch and it to the forest floor. The fox slipped and he fell off the branch, but landed safely in a pile of leaves near the apple. He picked up the apple in his mouth and quickly brought it back to his warm den. When he arrived back home, his two fox kits were waiting for him with hungry tummies. Spring, summer, autumn, or winter, it was always warm in the fox den.		Who did the fox get the apple for?

33	Animals love to walk near the train tracks. One night a beautiful black cat was walking along the train tracks looking for a nice mouse to eat. He came across some friends, Bob the cat and Steve the dog. They chose to go looking for food together. They walked up and down the tracks looking for a wonderful meal to snack on, when they happened across a big huge melon. Bob asked the black cat if he like melons, the cat did not like melons. Bob asked the dog if he liked melons, Steve did not like melons either. Bob then ate the melon himself as they looked around for that tasty treat. They heard bells from the train coming by and then they finally saw the food they were looking for jump from the bushes over the tracks and run straight into the barn nearby. The black cat wanted to eat the mouse, so he chased him into the barn. Minutes later the black cat returned with his meal in his mouth to share with his friends.		Did the train make noise at all?

He counted the cars that passed by. Along the way he saw his friend Lisa, and waved to her. She waved back, and came over. ""Hi Marvin,"" she said. ""Do you want to go to the lake today?"" Marvin smiled. ""Yeah!"" he said, ""let me go home and get my things."" So Marvin turned right around and went back home."

40	"There was once a small, grey cat that lived in the woods. This was a lonely old cat that spent most of his time bullying other small animals that lived in the woods. Almost all of the other little animals who lived in the woods knew of the old cat, and warned everyone they knew to stay away from him. \newline\newlineOne day a young mouse was out taking a walk to collect some berries. It was a nice day out, so the mouse chose to go down by the river to take a quick rest for a bit. When the mouse arrived at the river he found the perfect spot to rest. It was a small little area with soft sand to lie on, under a tree that gave a bit of shade. The mouse then sat back. After a little bit of time the mouse was fast asleep. \newline\newlineNot long after the mouse had fallen asleep, the cat caught a scent in the air of the young mouse. The cat walked slowly up to the spot where the mouse was sleeping and licked his lips. Right when the cat was about to catch the mouse, the mouse woke up.\newline\newline""What are you doing?!"" asked the mouse in surprise. \newline\newline""I am trying to find dinner,"" said the cat. \newline\newlineThe mouse smiled. ""I collected extra berries today on my walk. Would you like to have some?""\newline\newlineThe cat was confused. He had never been given such a kind thing. ""Well, OK. Berries are not my favorite, but I guess that they are OK."" \newline\newlineThe cat and mouse then sat down together and ate a meal of tasty berries. It turned out that the cat was not so terrible after all-but had never been given kindness."		What was the cat confused about?	The cat was confused about where the river was.

41	Sherry went out her back door and put on her sunglasses, large hat and heavy cloth work gloves.  She knelt in front of her small garden and started to pull weeds, throwing each in a small trashcan nearby.  As she worked she listened to the sounds of her neighbor's boys, Sam and Carl, playing. Sometimes she stopped long enough to sip from her bottle of water.\newline\newlineHer work and the heat of the day tired her out quickly, so she put her gardening tools away, dumped the weeds into the larger bin, and went back into her house to cool down and do some of the other items on her to-do list.  She chose to do laundry so she could sit and read as the washer and dryer ran.  Eventually the laundry was finished washing and drying, so she folded the laundry and put it away.\newline\newlineShe marked the chores she had completed her to-do list, then it was time for dinner.  First she filled the food bowl of her pet cat, Zoey, then she heated up some leftover lemon-garlic chicken saved from earlier in the week.\newline\newlineAfter dinner she made her bed with fresh sheets from the laundry she did earlier, finished reading her book, put on her pajamas, brushed her teeth, and went to sleep.\newline\newlineOverall, it had been a quiet but good day for Sherry, and she fell asleep feeling happy.

59	I was really scared walking into school today. It was the first day of sixth grade and I was excited to be leaving elementary school, but I ended up going to a different middle school than all my friends since I moved across town last year. My name is Matt, but I'm going to try and not let anyone else know that as I'd rather sit in the back and keep to myself. I didn't want to ride the bus, so my mom said she would drive me there for today. Thankfully I found my classroom, but I walked in and saw nobody I knew, as I thought. I took a seat at an empty table as the teacher, Mrs. Frank took roll call. She seemed nice, and I'm happy we weren't told to sit in alphabetical order or by boys to boys and girls to girls, as I was free to sit by myself for now. Mrs. Frank called out Jimmy, Sally, Linda, Jason, and then finally got to my name in which I raised my hand quickly. As soon as she was done, a few of the kids who arrived late came to sit by me and said their names were Martin and Mark.\newline\newlineMartin said he liked how our names all sounded the same, and Mark seconded that as we started talking before class began. When it was time to eat, we all said we would sit with one another in the lunch room, and also when it came to recess and playing together. It was nice to have some friends after being so nervous earlier, and see that everything does work out in the end. Hopefully soon we can all play together outside of class, but as far as today, it was a great start!		Why did Martin and Mark sit near Matt?	They arrived late to class and other seats were filled	The class was placed in alphabetical order	The boys had to sit with other boys and girls with other girls	They all had names that sounded alike	They arrived late to class and other seats were filled

60	A man sailed out to sea in a small boat. The sun was only rising, but this man liked spending all day fishing. A long way away from the shore, he stopped his boat. He pulled out his fishing pole and put some worms on the hook. He held it in the deep water and waited for a long time. After three hours there was still not a bite. The sun moved slowly across the sky. Morning turned into afternoon, and afternoon to evening. It was a slow day of fishing and he had to pack up. A fisherman does not give up so easy, even after many hours. It takes time to catch fish and fishing is not for people who give up quickly. The fisherman went home empty handed.

61	"One day, a boy named Sam went to the doctor because he fell and hurt his knee. He was riding his green tricycle in the yard when it happened. He played with yellow and red blocks in the waiting room before his visit with the doctor. His mother was sitting in a chair, reading a magazine and talking to other mothers sitting around her. The friendly nurse called Sam from the waiting room to finally visit the doctor. The nurse weighed Sam, measured his height, and asked him questions about the foods he had eaten that day. The nurse also took his temperature to make sure that he did not have a fever. After the nurse left the room, the doctor came in and asked Sam about his knee. Sam told the doctor all about his fall off the tricycle and the doctor wrote a lot of notes down. Doctors write a lot of notes so they can tell people like Sam more about their accidents. The doctor said, ""Wow Sam! It sounds like you had quite a fall."" The doctor put a bandage on his knee and gave him some medicine to take once he got home. On the way out of the doctor's office, Sam took a purple lollipop to eat on the car ride home. Sam's mom drove him back home, telling him to be careful for the next time that he plays outside.

66	There is a large tree in a park where all the kids in the neighborhood can hang out and play.  The tree was planted in 1896 and has grown to over fifty feet tall with branches that were another thirty feet wide.  Next to the tree is a jungle gym.  The jungle gym has two slides, a fireman pole, a rock climbing wall, and much more.  One day the kids in the neighborhood came up with the idea of building a tree house so they could spend all of their time at the park, even when it was raining outside.  The children all went to their parents begging them to help and get wood.  The families of the neighborhood began building the master tree house.  Upon completion the tree house was ten by twelve feet high, with two windows, and plenty of space for the children to have fun.  Every day during the summer that year the children played in the park and went in the tree house from sunrise to sunset every day.  Fifteen years have gone by and the children are now too old to use the tree house.  The tree house still sits on the tree but instead has a new group of kids that get to enjoy the house.  Now the first kids have become parents and get to watch their idea live on and make the children of the neighborhood happy.		What was built on the tree?

67	Jane was a dog who lived all alone, in a broken freezer in a dump. There was all kinds of junk in the dump, from a car, to a wooden cow, to a clock, but Jane's favorite thing she had was a giant sock. Jane was always chewing at the sock, and kept it with her in her freezer. When Jane was not chewing on the sock, she was running around in the dump, looking for things to eat, or things that were fun to sniff, or that she could bark at. Still, even when Jane was having fun doing other things, her favorite thing of all to do was chew on her giant sock. Sometimes Jane would see other animals in the dump. There were always birds around, as well as sometimes a snake, and once even a cat. A deer even came through once. Jane was quick to start barking at the cat, and she quickly scared it away and it never came back. The birds were something that Jane was always trying to catch. She was never fast enough, they would always fly far away before Jane even got close. But that didn't stop Jane from barking at them whenever she saw them. Jane liked being active. Even when Jane was all alone, she was active. Jane was a happy dog.		What item did Jane like the most?	Wooden cow	Clock	Car	Giant sock	Giant sock

73	There was once a frog who lived all the way in the North Pole. His name was Isaac. He worked at Santa's factory, baking cakes with lots of frosting. He didn't like making cake much. In fact, Isaac's dream was to work in the factory with the elves making toys. But since he was a frog, he was never allowed to build toys with the elves. One day, he got a smart idea. He would dress up as an elf and sneak into the factory, hoping no one would find out. So he got a hold of an elf costume and put it on. He put on the elf hat, the elf shirt, and the elf shoes. He really looked like an elf! So one day, when the factory was opening for the morning, Isaac snuck in line with the rest of the elves and tried to get into the factory. Luckily, it worked, and no one found out! Isaac was filled with joy as he had never seen the inside of the toy factory before. It was huge, and there were thousands of elves building toys for the children for next Christmas. He joined them in building, and for a long time, no one knew he was a frog. That is, until one elf, named Joe, saw that there was something weird about Isaac. He didn't look like the rest of the elves. So he kept his eye on Isaac, waiting to see what his secret was. One day, Isaac slipped, and his hat fell off. When this happened, Joe saw that he was a frog, and not an elf! He told Isaac that he would tell Santa all about how he had snuck in. Isaac begged Joe not to tell. Joe wanted to know what was in it for him, so Isaac promised to bake him a cake with lots of frosting. Joe never told.		Who was Isaac?

Allie got an old pillow case out of the hall closet.  She would use it to carry the candy she would get.  Allie's little sister, Grace, was going as a princess dressed in pink.  She had a shiny, silver purse on her arm.  Allie took Grace by the hand and led her down the sidewalk.

86	Amy and David had been best friends since Kindergarten. They had become friends on the very first day, since both of them loved airplanes. David had made a paper plane for his friend Pete, but he let Amy play with it as much as she wanted. He ended up giving it to her and making a new one for Pete, and another for himself. To thank him, she made him a paper heart. When it was recess, they went outside and flew their planes high into the air. They laughed when David's plane landed on the teacher's head. She laughed too and gave David back his plane.\newlineNow that they are older, Amy and David are learning more about planes and flying. Neither of them had ever been in a real airplane, but they watched them in movies and wanted to fly in one. Amy's mother knew about their dreams and set up a small trip for them across the state. As they were riding in the car, the kids could not contain their excitement. They talked all about what it would be like to finally fly in the sky and wondered about the things they would see. Amy's mother gave them a book about airplanes to read during the trip.\newlineWhen they got on the plane, Amy became afraid. Her mother calmed her down and gave her a new doll to hold to help her feel safe. When the plane took off, Amy and David both shouted with happiness and watched out the windows.

96	Randan's parents surprised her one day by bring home a small bunny. This was the first pet she had, so she started to shout and scream happily right when she saw it. After having keeping it in a cage in the house for a couple hours, she tried to take it outside to play. That was when everything went wrong. After she stepped outside, the cage fell and her thumb accidentally opened the cage, and the bunny ran away. Randan got very sad, but the bunny sounded like it was singing as it ran off. \newlineLater that night, Randan was still sad about the bunny as she was lying on her bed. All of a sudden, she heard a loud bang so everybody ran outside. They found the trash can tipped over and a lot of the food ate from it. Her dad wondered who did it, and Randan wondered if it was the bunny that ran away. She said to herself that it could not have done it. The bunny was way too small to even shake a trashcan.\newlineNothing special happened for the rest of the week, until they heard a strange noise on another night. This time, only Randan and her Dad went outside to check out what the noise was. When they made it outside, they saw an animal the size of a bear digging in their yard before it went deep. Before they even knew it, they heard their mama screaming from inside the house. They both looked in the window to see the bunny cornering the mama, but it had grown ten times bigger and looked angry. The dad quickly gave Randan a magical glove that makes her grip one million times stronger. The dad got some glue and made the bunny's butt stuck on the carpet.

106	I once was the leader of running a skills camp for a Boy Scout group. The weekend long camp included a lot of different games. One of the games was for fire-building. The point of the game was to help teach campers how to best build fires. There are many different ways you can build a campfire. You can build a lean-to campfire. You can also build a teepee fire. To build the fires you must find and sort different sizes of sticks and brush and larger logs to get the fire going. The goal of the game is to build a fire big enough to burn a string that is hanging a few feet above the ground. My group was falling behind, so I gave the idea of throwing a bunch of leaves on the fire all at once to make a huge fire to quickly burn the string. We were not allowed to win the game because it was said we cheated.		Did the group win the game?	Yes, by using a bunch of leaves.	Yes, they won	No, they did not win because they cheated.

He thought about joining the Marines, the Air-Force, or the Navy, but he liked the Army better. He was away for a long time. I didn't see him again until I was almost 8! He wrote me letters when he was gone, and sent me stripes from his uniform that Mom sewed on my jacket. We hung the flag on our front porch. We missed seeing him, so we talked to him on Skype. We could see the smile on his face when we talked to him. I missed him a lot. When Ryan came home again that Monday, it was the best day of my life! We went to the airport to pick him up. He had a long trip. It took many days for him to travel back home. He left the Army base 4 days before he finally got home. He was glad to sleep in his own room again. He let me camp out in his room. We stayed up late talking in whispers. He told me stories about the Army. Mom let me miss school the next day. I spent the whole day with my brother. He likes to chase me around and tickle me when he catches me. He lets me ride on his shoulders. I like to ride in his truck. I like to watch TV with him. We went on adventures. We laughed a lot. Ryan's visit went by too fast. Soon, it was time for him to go back. He left for the Army on Friday. It was a long way for him to ride in the airplane. He got back on Tuesday.

124	"In a big forest lived a fox named Manny. He was having a fun morning. Dad had given him a cookie as a snack and it was yummy! Now he was wandering through the woods, looking for an adventure. After a little bit he came across a frog sitting on a log. They looked at each other, but did not say anything. Manny spoke first. ""Hi there, my name is Manny and I'm a fox. Who are you?"" The frog on the log didn't answer at first. He finally said, ""My name is Tony and I'm a frog. My brother could beat you up."" Manny was very surprised to hear this.

Sometimes he'd find paint from a paint can.  Those were bad days.  Either way, he'd always get scared whenever the phone rang.  It was so loud and made him jump.  Yesterday he tripped over a wire because he wasn't looking where he was going. The television was on full volume so no one saw it.  He loved running around in the kitchen.  There was always leftover food on a spoon in the sink.  Sometimes it was dried food and he'd have to scrape it off with his claws.  It still tasted good to the mouse.  He was so happy there were no other animals living around there.  He had heard a piggy ate a lot more than a mouse.  He didn't want to have to fight a piggy over food.
