She invited all of her best friends. The party was at 1 on Saturday. Jessica, Erin, and Cathy all arrived at 1, but Jennifer was late. She did not come until 2, because she could not find her other shoe. The first thing they all did was go swimming in her pool. They had so much fun. They played with the foam noodles in the pool. Erin accidentally kicked Jennifer's leg in the pool. After they swam, everyone rinsed off and went inside. They ate cake, opened presents, and watched TV. After it got dark, they ran up and down the stairway, played telephone, and told spooky stories. Sally tripped going down the stairs and hurt her foot, but it felt better soon after.

Sandy was best friends with Alexis. Alexis was nice to Derek, but Sandy kept being mean. Sandy kicked dirt at Derek and called him mean names. Alexis felt bad that her friend was so nasty to Derek. Derek knew that Sandy did not like him, so he sat down in the school yard with a big frown. All of a sudden, a stranger walked up to Derek and asked him if he wanted some rock sugar candy. He told Derek he had lots of sugar rock candy in his car in the parking lot. Derek remembered his parents telling him never to talk to strangers, so he started running away from the man.

He asked his friends at school what would be a good idea for the Christmas show. They came up with lots of ideas but had trouble choosing which idea to use. One person wanted to do a dance show. Another person wanted to put on a play. So Joe told everyone to write their idea down on a piece of paper. Then he took everyone's idea, put it into a hat, mixed them up, and picked one idea. He read the idea out loud to his friends. It said, ""musical"". So Joe and his friends were going to put on a musical.\newline\newlineThe first thing Joe did was give each of his friends a different job. Jane, Rick, and Peter would be the singers in the show. Max and Sam would set up the stage and the lights. Marsha and Tammy would make the costumes.

Once her parents woke up, everybody got dressed to go food shopping for the week. Food shopping was one of Ashley's favorite things to do. The family got to the grocery store and grabbed a shopping cart. The first foods they ran into were the fruits. Ashley ran to pick her favorite fruit, apples, while her parents went and got other things that they needed, like the sour lemons. As the family kept walking through the grocery store Ashley begged for some candy that she saw, but the other things her parents bought were eggs, milk and bread. After all of the food was picked out, the family went up to the check-out line to pay for their food. Ashley never liked the check-out line, as it always took too long, but today was different.

I'm going to make a very special cake today,"" she said.\newline\newline""Wow, that sounds horrible,"" said John.\newline\newline""Yeah, we'd rather watch TV and eat potato chips,"" said Sally.\newline\newline""Don't talk back, kids.

Instead they took the short way through the forest.\newline\newline""I'm not afraid of a lion in the forest,"" said John. ""Besides, I think mom has been eating too many melon balls and is letting her imagination get away from her again. If there were a lion in the forest, we would know about it.""\newline\newlineSo they wandered along the forest path, jumping in mud puddles and throwing sticks at one another.

Bob asked the black cat if he like melons, the cat did not like melons. Bob asked the dog if he liked melons, Steve did not like melons either. Bob then ate the melon himself as they looked around for that tasty treat. They heard bells from the train coming by and then they finally saw the food they were looking for jump from the bushes over the tracks and run straight into the barn nearby.

She waved at her neighbor Jerry, who was taking his kitten out. Then she heard a loud noise. The noise was coming from a nearby tree. She walked over to the tree to take a look and found a puppy curled up by the roots. It was making a loud, sad noise. Sally bent down and picked up the puppy. It quickly quieted down, and licked her face. Sally laughed. The puppy was brown with white paws, and she thought it was the cutest puppy she ever saw. She couldn't find a tag on him, so she took him home. When she got home, she fed the puppy some meat that she had in her fridge. The puppy seemed to like it.

Natalie ate a biscuit.  Her brothers ate sausage and eggs.  Her father drank coffee.\newline\newlineAll three children loved the zoo.  Natalie's favorite animal was the gorilla.  She loved to watch him jump up and down.  She also liked it when he would pound on his chest and roar.  It was very exciting.  Logan's favorite animal was the giraffe.  He thought that it looked funny.  He also liked its spots.  Tim's favorite animal was the crocodile because it looked tough.  \newline\newlineNatalie, Logan, and Tim were not happy with the elephant.  He was their least favorite animal.

Not only that, but the sound of a high pitched voice, announcing ""It's here! It's here Janet, it's here!"" That voice belonged to my sister, Karen. What she meant was that the day had finally come for our family trip to the nearby beach located beyond Eagle Point. She got our parents out of bed way before they were ready to be up, but they knew how much it meant to her so they put a smile on as mother made breakfast and father packed the family car with towels and umbrellas. We could barely hear him say how there wasn't much room for many items, but he fit it all together like every year. I warned him last go around to get something larger like a truck, or a van, even joking an airplane, but he stuck to his guns and stayed with cars.\newline\newlineTruthfully, I had forgotten about the trip and made plans with my friends, Lauren and Matthew. As sad as I was to have to back out, I called the two of them and let them know of my mistake. They understood, and soon after we all entered the car and went on our way to the beach.

She was late and when she finally showed up she had forgotten the ball. \newline\newline""What can we use for a ball?"" Bob asked. \newlineThey looked around. There were rocks but they were too hard. There could get mud out of the pond but that would be too soft and splat when they hit it with the wooden bat. Finally Bob, being the tallest, saw that in a pile of plants that there were melons growing. \newline""Let's use a melon,"" Bob said.\newline""That's stupid,"" said Shelly, the practical one.\newline""No hear him out,"" said Lucy.

The tree was planted in 1896 and has grown to over fifty feet tall with branches that were another thirty feet wide.  Next to the tree is a jungle gym.  The jungle gym has two slides, a fireman pole, a rock climbing wall, and much more.  One day the kids in the neighborhood came up with the idea of building a tree house so they could spend all of their time at the park, even when it was raining outside.  The children all went to their parents begging them to help and get wood.  The families of the neighborhood began building the master tree house.  Upon completion the tree house was ten by twelve feet high, with two windows, and plenty of space for the children to have fun.  Every day during the summer that year the children played in the park and went in the tree house from sunrise to sunset every day.  Fifteen years have gone by and the children are now too old to use the tree house.  The tree house still sits on the tree but instead has a new group of kids that get to enjoy the house.

All Tiger had to do was make an oink and Tabby would come running to check on Tiger. Sometimes Tiger got into fights with his brother Tom and Tabby always took Tiger's side. One time Tiger accidentally lit a bush on fire when he was playing with a looking glass and the bush burned to the ground. Tabby was very mad and Tiger blamed it on Tom. Tabby believed Tiger, because she thought Tom was a trouble maker. One time Tabby took a trip to the ocean and she took Tiger, but not Tom. Tom was very upset, but acted like he didn't want to go. Tom said he would rather go to the forest, the moon or the mountains, but never would he go to the ocean. This wasn't true, but Tom didn't want to let Tiger and Tabby know that they hurt him. When Tabby and Tom went to the ocean, their uncle Leon came to visit and to take care of Tom. Tom had never met Leon before. Leon loved Tom and made him feel very special. When Tabby and Tom came home Leon left and Tom went to live with him. They went to the ocean together; the mountains, the forest and Leon even took Tom to the moon.

292,"{'story': mc500.test.73, 'question': 0}",Who was Isaac?,"There was once a frog who lived all the way in the North Pole. His name was Isaac. He worked at Santa's factory, baking cakes with lots of frosting. He didn't like making cake much. In fact, Isaac's dream was to work in the factory with the elves making toys. But since he was a frog, he was never allowed to build toys with the elves. One day, he got a smart idea. He would dress up as an elf and sneak into the factory, hoping no one would find out. So he got a hold of an elf costume and put it on. He put on the elf hat, the elf shirt, and the elf shoes. He really looked like an elf! So one day, when the factory was opening for the morning, Isaac snuck in line with the rest of the elves and tried to get into the factory. Luckily, it worked, and no one found out! Isaac was filled with joy as he had never seen the inside of the toy factory before. It was huge, and there were thousands of elves building toys for the children for next Christmas. He joined them in building, and for a long time, no one knew he was a frog. That is, until one elf, named Joe, saw that there was something weird about Isaac. He didn't look like the rest of the elves. So he kept his eye on Isaac, waiting to see what his secret was. One day, Isaac slipped, and his hat fell off.

She had made them a picnic lunch, including sandwiches, fruit and potato chips. As they looked around the park, they watched the other families play and eat lunch. There was one family that had 3 dogs with them. The dogs were chasing each other and playing Frisbee with their people. Another family had a big blanket set out and were watching their baby learn to crawl on his tummy. Anthony asked his sister if she wanted the rest of his potato chips. Michelle said no, that she was full. They got up and went over to the family with the dogs. The white dog jumped on Michelle and licked her face, knocking her down. The brown dog wagged his tail and sniffed Anthony. The black dog was shy and went to sit with his family.

312,"{'story': mc500.test.78, 'question': 0}",What did she read about in the magazine?,"Millie thought she would like to stop eating meat, but she didn't know if she could do it.  Once, when she was younger, she had tried to go without eating meat, but before the first day was over, her stomach had felt a little empty.  ""Hmm,"" she had thought.  ""Maybe it's not good for me to stop eating meat.  Maybe that's why I feel so hungry.""\newline\newlineBut, now, she wondered if there was anything she could do so she wouldn't feel so hungry, even if she did stop eating meat.\newline\newlineShe went to the library, and there, she saw a magazine.

On Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and on the weekends, his master would even put him a plastic ball that allowed him to run all across the house, as long as he stayed in the ball. Harry loved the plastic ball, and he even liked his master, but Harry wanted to see the outside of the orange house he had lived in for as long as he could remember. He wanted to feel the rain on his fur, wanted to eat wild seeds that fell from the tree. He wanted to be free! He would watch the flowers come up in the spring from his window, and the snow fall in the winters, always wanting to know what the seasons felt like. \tab\newline\newlineOne Tuesday morning in the summer, Harry woke up to the sun shining down into his cage in the middle of the room that he stayed in. ""Today is the day I see the world!"" Harry yelled to himself. He waited for his master to put him in his plastic ball. He thought as long as he could make it to the door, he would be free. His master soon came into the room, slowly picked Harry out of the cage, put Harry inside his ball, and closed the lid.

Under that picture was a box full of candy. Bob knew that he did not want to eat too much candy, but he wanted to get some candy anyway.

First, Miss Walter, the principal, bought the tables and chairs for the bake sale. Next, Miss Holly, the second grade teacher, bought plates and forks and spoons. But Miss Holly forgot to buy the napkins! One of the other second grade teachers ended up buying napkins along with cups for milk and juice. On Friday, all of the students brought in their baked goods and drinks. Nancy brought chocolate chip cookies. Alex brought brownies. Jose brought vanilla cupcakes. Patty brought lemonade and apple juice. The bake sale raised enough money for two field trips!","{'author': 3593402326, 'work_time': 1141, 'quality_score': 100, 'creativity_words': [jelly, game, feathering, chocolate, storm, forward, boot, down, teacher, yellow, body, second, farmer, feathering, cow]}","{'A': To buy new tables and chairs., 'B': To have a pizza party., 'C': Because they wanted to eat brownies., 'D': To raise money for a field trip.}",D,True,"<b>T</b>he <b>sec</b>ond <b>gr</b>ade <b>stud</b>ents <b>a</b>t <b>Val</b>ley <b>Eleme</b>ntary <b>Sch</b>ool <b>we</b>re <b>go</b>ing <b>t</b>o <b>p</b>ut <b>o</b>n <b>ba</b>ke <b>sa</b>le. <b>Th</b>ey <b>wan</b>ted <b>t</b>o <b>ra</b>ise <b>eno</b>ugh <b>mo</b>ney <b>t</b>o <b>ta</b>ke <b>fi</b>eld <b>tr</b>ip <b>t</b>o <b>t</b>he <b>zo</b>o. <b>Th</b>ey <b>inv</b>ited <b>a</b>ll <b>o</b>f <b>t</b>he <b>ot</b>her <b>stud</b>ents <b>a</b>nd <b>teac</b>hers. <b>Th</b>ey <b>al</b>so <b>inv</b>ited <b>t</b>he <b>prin</b>cipal <b>a</b>nd <b>th</b>eir <b>par</b>ents <b>t</b>o <b>co</b>me! <b>Th</b>ey <b>we</b>re <b>go</b>ing <b>t</b>o <b>ha</b>ve <b>t</b>he <b>ba</b>ke <b>sa</b>le <b>o</b>n <b>Fri</b>day <b>after</b>noon. <b>To</b>day <b>w</b>as <b>Mon</b>day, <b>s</b>o <b>th</b>ey <b>on</b>ly <b>h</b>ad <b>fo</b>ur <b>da</b>ys <b>t</b>o <b>g</b>et <b>every</b>thing <b>toge</b>ther! <b>Fir</b>st, <b>Mi</b>ss <b>Wal</b>ter, <b>t</b>he <b>princ</b>ipal, <b>bou</b>ght <b>t</b>he <b>tab</b>les <b>a</b>nd <b>cha</b>irs <b>f</b>or <b>t</b>he <b>ba</b>ke <b>sa</b>le. <b>Ne</b>xt, <b>Mi</b>ss <b>Hol</b>ly, <b>t</b>he <b>sec</b>ond <b>gr</b>ade <b>teac</b>her, <b>bou</b>ght <b>pla</b>tes <b>a</b>nd <b>fo</b>rks <b>a</b>nd <b>spo</b>ons. <b>B</b>ut <b>Mi</b>ss <b>Ho</b>lly <b>for</b>got <b>t</b>o <b>b</b>uy <b>t</b>he <b>napk</b>ins! <b>O</b>ne <b>o</b>f <b>t</b>he <b>ot</b>her <b>sec</b>ond <b>gr</b>ade <b>teac</b>hers <b>en</b>ded <b>u</b>p <b>buy</b>ing <b>nap</b>kins <b>al</b>ong <b>wi</b>th <b>cu</b>ps <b>f</b>or <b>mi</b>lk <b>a</b>nd <b>jui</b>ce. <b>O</b>n <b>Fri</b>day, <b>a</b>ll <b>o</b>f <b>t</b>he <b>stud</b>ents <b>bro</b>ught <b>i</b>n <b>th</b>eir <b>ba</b>ked <b>go</b>ods <b>a</b>nd <b>dri</b>nks. <b>Na</b>ncy <b>bro</b>ught <b>choc</b>olate <b>ch</b>ip <b>cook</b>ies. <b>Al</b>ex <b>bro</b>ught <b>brow</b>nies. <b>Jo</b>se <b>bro</b>ught <b>van</b>illa <b>cupc</b>akes. <b>Pa</b>tty <b>bro</b>ught <b>lemo</b>nade <b>a</b>nd <b>ap</b>ple <b>jui</b>ce. <b>T</b>he <b>ba</b>ke <b>sa</b>le <b>rai</b>sed <b>eno</b>ugh <b>mo</b>ney <b>f</b>or <b>t</b>wo <b>fi</b>eld <b>tri</b>ps!"

Boo longed for a goldfish more than anything in the world, so he begged and begged his parents for one.  Finally, his parents told him that he could have a goldfish if he found it himself. With that, Boo set out to look for a goldfish.  First he looked under his pillow.  No goldfish there.  Then he looked in the fridge.  No goldfish their either.  Frustrated, he went to his friend Miles.  Miles was an alligator.  Boo asked Miles, ""Miles, where could I find a goldfish?""\newline\newlineMiles thought long and hard.  Then he thought some more.  He thought even more after that.  At long last, Miles spoke.  ""I have an idea,"" he said, ""but you must do a few things for me first.  First you must clap for me.""\newline\newlineBoo clapped many times.  ""Now,"" spoke Miles, ""You must chirp like a young bird.""  Boo chirped happily.  \newline\newline""Last,"" said Miles, ""You must fold my laundry.  It is behind the wood pile.""  Boo quickly set to work folding the laundry.  When he was all done he returned to Miles.\newline\newline""Miles,"" he asked, ""Where can I find a goldfish?""\newline\newlineMiles smiled as he spoke, ""Fish swim, yes?  Look in a place with water.""\newline\newlineBoo quickly returned home and began his hunt.  First he looked in his drink cup.  No goldfish there.  Then he looked in the toilet.

This was the first pet she had, so she started to shout and scream happily right when she saw it. After having keeping it in a cage in the house for a couple hours, she tried to take it outside to play. That was when everything went wrong. After she stepped outside, the cage fell and her thumb accidentally opened the cage, and the bunny ran away. Randan got very sad, but the bunny sounded like it was singing as it ran off. \newlineLater that night, Randan was still sad about the bunny as she was lying on her bed. All of a sudden, she heard a loud bang so everybody ran outside. They found the trash can tipped over and a lot of the food ate from it.

There he found his neighbor Ashley, who was also an evil superhero. John thought she was an evil superhero at least. When John got to the bus stop, Ashley made a silly face at him. Then she dared him to lick a worm she found on the sidewalk. John had super powers, so he said yes to the dare. He picked up the worm. It was slimy and gross. It wiggled around between his fingers. John closed his eyes and licked it. Ashley laughed so hard, she fell to the ground. But John felt like a real superhero who had won the day for good kids everywhere.

It was made of metal, and looked worn and old. The girl said, this bell gave me my wish for a pink dress, but in order to keep my wish, I have to give the bell to someone else. Ring the bell three times to get your wish. Not two, not four, but three. When your wish arrives, give the bell to someone else. Pedro thanked the girl for the bell, and when she had gone, he rang the bell three times and wished for a puppy. Soon after, he saw a puppy on a street corner.

He left the Army base 4 days before he finally got home. He was glad to sleep in his own room again. He let me camp out in his room. We stayed up late talking in whispers. He told me stories about the Army. Mom let me miss school the next day. I spent the whole day with my brother. He likes to chase me around and tickle me when he catches me. He lets me ride on his shoulders. I like to ride in his truck. I like to watch TV with him. We went on adventures. We laughed a lot. Ryan's visit went by too fast. Soon, it was time for him to go back. He left for the Army on Friday. It was a long way for him to ride in the airplane. He got back on Tuesday. I can't wait to see him again. Next time, we'll visit him on vacation. I want to see the Army trucks and helicopters.","{'author': 3407600452, 'work_time': 5396, 'quality_score': 90, 'creativity_words': [sticker, aunt, mirror, sleep, pumpkin, people, friendly, singing, coat, chin, purple, harder, die, bowl, tricycle]}","{'A': Navy, 'B': Army, 'C': Air-Force, 'D': Marines}",B,False,"<b>M</b>y <b>bro</b>ther <b>Ry</b>an <b>i</b>s <b>1</b>2 <b>ye</b>ars <b>ol</b>der <b>th</b>an <b>m</b>e. <b>H</b>e <b>i</b>s <b>m</b>y <b>be</b>st <b>fri</b>end, <b>a</b>nd <b>t</b>he <b>coo</b>lest <b>hu</b>man <b>o</b>n <b>Ear</b>th. <b>Ri</b>ght <b>bef</b>ore <b>tur</b>ned <b>o</b>ne <b>sum</b>mer, <b>h</b>e <b>le</b>ft <b>ho</b>me <b>t</b>o <b>jo</b>in <b>t</b>he <b>Ar</b>my. <b>H</b>e <b>tho</b>ught <b>ab</b>out <b>joi</b>ning <b>t</b>he <b>Mari</b>nes, <b>t</b>he <b>Air-F</b>orce, <b>o</b>r <b>t</b>he <b>Na</b>vy, <b>b</b>ut <b>h</b>e <b>li</b>ked <b>t</b>he <b>Ar</b>my <b>bet</b>ter. <b>H</b>e <b>w</b>as <b>aw</b>ay <b>f</b>or <b>lo</b>ng <b>ti</b>me. <b>did</b>n't <b>s</b>ee <b>h</b>im <b>ag</b>ain <b>un</b>til <b>w</b>as <b>alm</b>ost <b>8</b>! <b>H</b>e <b>wr</b>ote <b>m</b>e <b>let</b>ters <b>wh</b>en <b>h</b>e <b>w</b>as <b>go</b>ne, <b>a</b>nd <b>se</b>nt <b>m</b>e <b>str</b>ipes <b>fr</b>om <b>h</b>is <b>uni</b>form <b>th</b>at <b>M</b>om <b>se</b>wed <b>o</b>n <b>m</b>y <b>jac</b>ket. <b>W</b>e <b>hu</b>ng <b>t</b>he <b>fl</b>ag <b>o</b>n <b>o</b>ur <b>fr</b>ont <b>por</b>ch. <b>W</b>e <b>mis</b>sed <b>see</b>ing <b>hi</b>m, <b>s</b>o <b>w</b>e <b>tal</b>ked <b>t</b>o <b>h</b>im <b>o</b>n <b>Sky</b>pe. <b>W</b>e <b>co</b>uld <b>s</b>ee <b>t</b>he <b>sm</b>ile <b>o</b>n <b>h</b>is <b>fa</b>ce <b>wh</b>en <b>w</b>e <b>tal</b>ked <b>t</b>o <b>hi</b>m. <b>mis</b>sed <b>h</b>im <b>lo</b>t. <b>Wh</b>en <b>Ry</b>an <b>ca</b>me <b>ho</b>me <b>ag</b>ain <b>th</b>at <b>Mon</b>day, <b>i</b>t <b>w</b>as <b>t</b>he <b>be</b>st <b>d</b>ay <b>o</b>f <b>m</b>y <b>li</b>fe! <b>W</b>e <b>we</b>nt <b>t</b>o <b>t</b>he <b>air</b>port <b>t</b>o <b>pi</b>ck <b>h</b>im <b>u</b>p. <b>H</b>e <b>h</b>ad <b>lo</b>ng <b>tr</b>ip. <b>I</b>t <b>to</b>ok <b>ma</b>ny <b>da</b>ys <b>f</b>or <b>h</b>im <b>t</b>o <b>tra</b>vel <b>ba</b>ck <b>ho</b>me. <b>H</b>e <b>le</b>ft <b>t</b>he <b>Ar</b>my <b>ba</b>se <b>da</b>ys <b>bef</b>ore <b>h</b>e <b>fin</b>ally <b>g</b>ot <b>ho</b>me. <b>H</b>e <b>w</b>as <b>gl</b>ad <b>t</b>o <b>sl</b>eep <b>i</b>n <b>h</b>is <b>o</b>wn <b>ro</b>om <b>aga</b>in. <b>H</b>e <b>l</b>et <b>m</b>e <b>ca</b>mp <b>o</b>ut <b>i</b>n <b>h</b>is <b>ro</b>om. <b>W</b>e <b>sta</b>yed <b>u</b>p <b>la</b>te <b>tal</b>king <b>i</b>n <b>whis</b>pers. <b>H</b>e <b>to</b>ld <b>m</b>e <b>sto</b>ries <b>ab</b>out <b>t</b>he <b>Ar</b>my. <b>M</b>om <b>l</b>et <b>m</b>e <b>mi</b>ss <b>sch</b>ool <b>t</b>he <b>ne</b>xt <b>da</b>y. <b>sp</b>ent <b>t</b>he <b>wh</b>ole <b>d</b>ay <b>wi</b>th <b>m</b>y <b>brot</b>her. <b>H</b>e <b>li</b>kes <b>t</b>o <b>ch</b>ase <b>m</b>e <b>aro</b>und <b>a</b>nd <b>tic</b>kle <b>m</b>e <b>wh</b>en <b>h</b>e <b>cat</b>ches <b>m</b>e. <b>H</b>e <b>le</b>ts <b>m</b>e <b>ri</b>de <b>o</b>n <b>h</b>is <b>shoul</b>ders. <b>li</b>ke <b>t</b>o <b>ri</b>de <b>i</b>n <b>h</b>is <b>tru</b>ck. <b>li</b>ke <b>t</b>o <b>wa</b>tch <b>T</b>V <b>wi</b>th <b>hi</b>m. <b>W</b>e <b>we</b>nt <b>o</b>n <b>adven</b>tures. <b>W</b>e <b>lau</b>ghed <b>lo</b>t. <b>Rya</b>n's <b>vi</b>sit <b>we</b>nt <b>b</b>y <b>t</b>oo <b>fa</b>st. <b>So</b>on, <b>i</b>t <b>w</b>as <b>ti</b>me <b>f</b>or <b>h</b>im <b>t</b>o <b>g</b>o <b>ba</b>ck. <b>H</b>e <b>le</b>ft <b>f</b>or <b>t</b>he <b>Ar</b>my <b>o</b>n <b>Fri</b>day. <b>I</b>t <b>w</b>as <b>lo</b>ng <b>w</b>ay <b>f</b>or <b>h</b>im <b>t</b>o <b>ri</b>de <b>i</b>n <b>t</b>he <b>airp</b>lane. <b>H</b>e <b>g</b>ot <b>ba</b>ck <b>o</b>n <b>Tues</b>day. <b>ca</b>n't <b>wa</b>it <b>t</b>o <b>s</b>ee <b>h</b>im <b>aga</b>in. <b>Ne</b>xt <b>ti</b>me, <b>we</b>'ll <b>vi</b>sit <b>h</b>im <b>o</b>n <b>vaca</b>tion. <b>wa</b>nt <b>t</b>o <b>s</b>ee <b>t</b>he <b>Ar</b>my <b>tru</b>cks <b>a</b>nd <b>helico</b>pters."

He had to go to a special school for seven years. Learning to be a doctor is difficult. Only very smart and hardworking people can become doctors. Mark was not sad when he was studying. He enjoyed learning all about why people get sick and how to make them feel better.\newline\newlineNow, Mark is a very good doctor. Sometimes other doctors ask him questions, because he knows more about some things that they do. Jim and Alice are two other doctors who became friends with Mark. Jim is 40 years old, and Alice is 25 years old.

This confused him because he thought he had been riding in a different direction.  Steve learned that there really was no place like home.  He put his horse in the barn and went back into his house.","{'author': 4050452632, 'work_time': 1046, 'quality_score': 95, 'creativity_words': [freeze, trashcan, orange, make, cowboy, die, cross, potty, poke, silence, horse, reading, hush, face, white]}","{'A': Sunny, 'B': Silence, 'C': Raindrop, 'D': Ice}",D,True,"<b>cow</b>boy <b>na</b>med <b>St</b>eve <b>wan</b>ted <b>t</b>o <b>ta</b>ke <b>vaca</b>tion <b>fr</b>om <b>h</b>is <b>fa</b>rm <b>th</b>at <b>w</b>as <b>na</b>med <b>Rain</b>drop. <b>H</b>e <b>co</b>uld <b>n</b>ot <b>ma</b>ke <b>u</b>p <b>h</b>is <b>mi</b>nd <b>wh</b>ere <b>t</b>o <b>g</b>o, <b>s</b>o <b>h</b>e <b>sad</b>dled <b>h</b>is <b>ho</b>rse <b>a</b>nd <b>ro</b>de <b>ea</b>st. <b>T</b>he <b>s</b>un <b>w</b>as <b>set</b>ting <b>i</b>n <b>t</b>he <b>we</b>st <b>a</b>nd <b>i</b>t <b>w</b>as <b>ora</b>nge. <b>co</b>ld <b>wi</b>nd <b>w</b>as <b>blo</b>wing <b>fr</b>om <b>no</b>rth <b>t</b>o <b>sou</b>th. <b>St</b>eve <b>ro</b>de <b>thr</b>ough <b>for</b>est <b>o</b>f <b>pe</b>ar <b>tr</b>ees <b>ne</b>xt <b>t</b>o <b>h</b>is <b>farm.\newlin</b>e\newlineThe <b>fi</b>rst <b>pl</b>ace <b>h</b>e <b>ca</b>me <b>t</b>o <b>w</b>as <b>sm</b>all <b>to</b>wn <b>fu</b>ll <b>o</b>f <b>qu</b>iet <b>peo</b>ple <b>a</b>nd <b>i</b>ts <b>na</b>me <b>w</b>as <b>Sile</b>nce. <b>N</b>o <b>o</b>ne <b>wo</b>uld <b>ta</b>lk <b>t</b>o <b>Ste</b>ve. <b>H</b>e <b>ke</b>pt <b>rid</b>ing. <b>T</b>he <b>to</b>wn <b>w</b>as <b>ne</b>xt <b>t</b>o <b>for</b>est <b>o</b>f <b>ma</b>ple <b>trees.\newli</b>ne\newlineThe <b>sec</b>ond <b>to</b>wn <b>h</b>e <b>ca</b>me <b>t</b>o <b>w</b>as <b>ve</b>ry <b>co</b>ld <b>a</b>nd <b>i</b>ts <b>na</b>me <b>w</b>as <b>Ic</b>e. <b>St</b>eve <b>w</b>as <b>afr</b>aid <b>h</b>is <b>ho</b>rse <b>wo</b>uld <b>fre</b>eze <b>i</b>f <b>h</b>e <b>sta</b>yed <b>the</b>re. <b>Ever</b>yone <b>i</b>n <b>t</b>he <b>to</b>wn <b>w</b>as <b>wea</b>ring <b>la</b>rge <b>co</b>ats <b>a</b>nd <b>mitt</b>ens. <b>T</b>he <b>sec</b>ond <b>to</b>wn <b>w</b>as <b>ne</b>xt <b>t</b>o <b>for</b>est <b>o</b>f <b>pi</b>ne <b>tre</b>es. <b>\newline\</b>newlineThe <b>th</b>ird <b>to</b>wn <b>h</b>e <b>ca</b>me <b>t</b>o <b>w</b>as <b>wa</b>rm <b>a</b>nd <b>i</b>t <b>w</b>as <b>na</b>med <b>Sun</b>ny. <b>Th</b>ere <b>we</b>re <b>pa</b>lm <b>tr</b>ees <b>o</b>n <b>t</b>he <b>bea</b>ch. <b>St</b>eve <b>a</b>nd <b>h</b>is <b>ho</b>rse <b>we</b>nt <b>t</b>o <b>t</b>he <b>be</b>ach <b>a</b>nd <b>pla</b>yed <b>i</b>n <b>t</b>he <b>oce</b>an. <b>St</b>eve <b>to</b>ok <b>o</b>ff <b>h</b>is <b>boo</b>ts. <b>Ste</b>ve's <b>h</b>at <b>g</b>ot <b>w</b>et <b>i</b>n <b>t</b>he <b>wat</b>er. <b>H</b>e <b>h</b>ad <b>t</b>o <b>le</b>ave <b>i</b>t <b>o</b>n <b>t</b>he <b>be</b>ach <b>t</b>o <b>dr</b>y. <b>Event</b>ually <b>St</b>eve <b>a</b>nd <b>h</b>is <b>ho</b>rse <b>g</b>ot <b>ho</b>t. <b>Th</b>ey <b>ro</b>de <b>ea</b>st <b>again.\newline\n</b>ewlineEventually <b>St</b>eve <b>arr</b>ived <b>ba</b>ck <b>a</b>t <b>h</b>is <b>fa</b>rm. <b>Th</b>is <b>conf</b>used <b>h</b>im <b>bec</b>ause <b>h</b>e <b>tho</b>ught <b>h</b>e <b>h</b>ad <b>be</b>en <b>rid</b>ing <b>i</b>n <b>diff</b>erent <b>direc</b>tion. <b>St</b>eve <b>lea</b>rned <b>th</b>at <b>th</b>ere <b>rea</b>lly <b>w</b>as <b>n</b>o <b>pl</b>ace <b>li</b>ke <b>ho</b>me. <b>H</b>e <b>p</b>ut <b>h</b>is <b>ho</b>rse <b>i</b>n <b>t</b>he <b>ba</b>rn <b>a</b>nd <b>we</b>nt <b>ba</b>ck <b>in</b>to <b>h</b>is <b>hou</b>se."

Steve owns many pump-jacks and is having a very tough time keeping them working. During the summer in West Texas the temperature can be over 100, which causes these machines to break often.

Albert chose to build something big to share with his kid, so he wanted to make a tree house.  Albert had to choose what kind of stuff to make the tree house out of.  Wood is popular, but splinters would hurt his son.  Metal is very strong, but it would also be very hard to use.  Plastic is not expensive, but it also bends a lot. The last choice was to give up, but Albert really wanted to do this for his son.  It would make him very happy.  Albert ended up choosing wood, as it was the most popular choice.  Albert went to the store to buy nails, tools, and wood, but forgot to buy glue.  He had to go back there and he finally had everything he needed.  He got started and it was very hard.  One hour went by, then two, then three, then four.  Finally, on the fifth hour, Albert finally finished the tree house.  His son ran out and jumped into his dad's arms.  They both looked at it, and Albert's son gave his dad a kiss for all the hard work he had done.  Albert looked at the tree house he had built and was very happy.

Tracy's favorite animal is the monkey. Ryan's favorite animal is the rabbit. But Larry's favorite animal is the panda. The only problem is that Larry has never seen a panda. In fact, none of Larry's friends have seen one. One time, Larry and his friends went to the zoo. There were many animals at the zoo, and everyone was very excited to them. There were monkeys, bears, and even rabbits. When they went to see the monkeys, Tracy even handed one of the monkeys a banana and the monkey ate it. But there was no panda. Everyone started to think there was no such thing as a panda.\newline\newlineIf Larry was going to see a panda, he would have find one himself. He packed up his backpack with sandwiches, a chocolate bar, and some water and he went out into the forest. He knew that a panda's favorite food was leaves, so made sure to pack some leaves in his backpack too. He spent two week in the forest looking everywhere for a panda. Finally, when has about to give up, he saw a family of pandas eating and playing. He gave them all the leaves in his backpack. He sat watching them for the rest of the day.

Greg really wanted to win the race! On Saturday, Greg and his mother went to the race. It was being held on the track at his school. They put their racing car on the track, and a man started to count down from 10. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, GO! Greg pushed his car forward as fast as he could! It reached the finish line before everyone else!
